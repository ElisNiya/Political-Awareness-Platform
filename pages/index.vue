        This platform created to heal the relationship problem
        between citizens and politicians/political parties. Hopefully, this
        platform may help citizens and political parties to understand each other
        better.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        There are 3 goals of this platform :
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Goal I: Understanding each party's purpose. Most of the citizens can
        only name a few political parties however there are ususaly more than thier aknowlegde registered parties to
        vote on. Therefore, this platform aims to help citizens to get to know
        every single option when it comes to voting. Many people do not like
        politics and do not feel like voting for any party at all because they
        do not like the popular parties or do not know of the unpopular parties
        because of the media influence. Therefore, in this platform every party
        will be portrayed equally and hopefully, citizens will gain access to
        knowledge of not well-known parties as well.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Goal II: This platform also aims to find out what people think about
        each party, positively and negatively. Therefore we can see what parties
        good and bad at according to the citizens. Then we can easily compare
        parties, and politicians can also understand what citizens think about
        them in general.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Goal III: Eventually, this platform will also help citizens to
        express their ideas or desires from an imaginary political party, what
        to focus on, and what to avoid the most. Therefore, political parties
        can see what citizens care about the most and the least.
